Infinite Graph INSTALL
=======================

The infinite graph solution aims at increasing the ability of Jena to create large RDF graphs based on a caching algorithm derived from various memory management algorithms. We also use Lucene to index the nodes that need to be written to disk.
 
To use this software all the .jar files under lib/ must be on the classpath and must be available to your application.

Also use the "create-jena-patch" target from the build.xml file to create a patch and place this patch on the classpath.
 
Infinite graph is tested with these .jar files.
